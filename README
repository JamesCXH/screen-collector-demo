screen_action_recorder.py captures your macOS screen with ffmpeg and writes a time‑stamped JSON file of “critical actions” you perform while recording.

Critical action + how they're captured
- left_click: plain left‑button press and release
- right_click: right‑button click
- ctrl_left_click: hold Ctrl while left‑clicking
- left_drag: left‑button press, move, release (coords logged)
- command_combo: any key pressed while ⌘ is held (e.g. ⌘‑C)
- typing: printable characters + SPECIAL chars (newline, delete, backspace) grouped into a phrase; a phrase closes after 5s of keyboard silence (TYPING_GAP) OR if (start of) critical action is heard
    - uses .isprintable()

It's VERY

Action entries contain: kind, human‑readable description, start time, end time (seconds since recording began).

How detection works
Mouse and keyboard events are captured with pynput. Clicks/combos are logged immediately; drags and typing phrases are closed when the button is released or the typing gap elapses.

CLI flags
-f, --fps N video frame‑rate (default 30)
--debug save a full‑screen PNG at the start and end of every action in recordings/<N>/screenshots/

Output folder per session
recordings/<N>/recording.mp4 final video
recordings/<N>/recording.json action log
screenshots/… only when --debug is used

Stop recording with Esc.
